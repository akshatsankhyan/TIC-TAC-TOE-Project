# TIC-TAC-TOE-Project

Hey Readers!
Tic-tac-toe is a two player game (one of them being your computer program). 
The two players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. 
The player who first gets 3 of his/her marks in a row 
(vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game, and the other loses the game.
